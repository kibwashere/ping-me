# Ping Me

The idea is to receive notifications from few tools (ie. Slack, Gmail, FCM, ..) trigged by an action (ie. Shelly Button 1).

This repo is only an example of what it might look like using kznjunk packages.

The `.env` file should contains stuff such as:

```
SLACK_TOKEN=

EMAIL_FROM=
EMAIL_TO=
EMAIL_CLIENTID=
EMAIL_CLIENTSECRET=
EMAIL_REFRESHTOKEN=

FCM_CONFIG_PATH=
FCM_TOPIC=
```
